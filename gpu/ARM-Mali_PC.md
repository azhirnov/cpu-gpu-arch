## Notes

**CSF** - Command Stream Front-end.<br/>
**MCU** - Microcontroller Unit / Multi-level Memory Cache Unit ?<br/>

**Job** - GPU command, executed on Job Manager, it tracks inter-job dependencies, distributes jobs across shader cores, splits jobs into per-core tasks.<br/>
**Task** - part of job, executed on core.<br/>
**Fragment Task** - region of 32x32 (64x64 for Valhal 5gen) pixels.<br/>
**Iterator** - ?<br/>
**MMU** - Memory management unit.<br/>
**ALU** - arithmetic unit in the execution engine, contains pipes: FMA, CVT, SFU.<br/>
**CS0** - ?<br/>
**CEU** - ?<br/>
**Warp** - group of 4-16 threads.<br/>
**Vertex position shading** - part of vertex shader which outputs only vertex position.<br/>
**Binning phase** - includes vertex position shading, culling, and primitive binning.<br/>
**Main phase** - includes any deferred vertex processing and all fragment shading.<br/>
**Tiler** - responsible for coordinating geometry processing and providing the fixed-function tiling needed for the tile-based rendering pipeline. It can run in parallel to vertex shading and fragment shading.<br/>
**Quad** - 2x2 pixels<br/>
**Load/store unit (LS, LSU)** - used for general-purpose memory accesses, and includes vertex attribute access, buffer access, work group shared memory access, and stack access, also implements imageLoad/Store and atomic access functionality. (The load/store pipeline handles all non-texture memory access, including buffer access, image access, and atomic operations.)<br/>
**Front-end** - queue which placed before Execution core, can be NonFragFrontend / FragFrontend.<br/>
**Back-end** - queue which placed after Execution core, only fragment queue has backend.<br/>
**Varying unit (V)** - The varying pipeline is a dedicated pipeline which implements the varying interpolator.<br/>
**TLB** -  Translation Look-aside Buffer ?<br/>
**EC** - Execution Core.<br/>
**PE** - Processing Engine.<br/>

Execution core / Processing unit (ALU ?):<br/>
**FMA pipe** - Arithmetic fused multiply accumulate unit (FMA). The FMA pipelines are the main arithmetic pipelines, implementing the floating-point multipliers that are widely used in shader code. Each FMA pipeline implements a 16-wide warp, and can issue a single 32-bit operation or two 16-bit operations per thread and per clock cycle. Most programs that are arithmetic-limited are limited by the performance of the FMA pipeline.<br/>
**CVT pipe** - Arithmetic convert unit (CVT). The CVT pipelines implement simple operations, such as format conversion and integer addition. Each CVT pipeline implements a 16-wide warp, and can issue a single 32-bit operation or two 16-bit operations per thread and per clock cycle.<br/>
**SFU pipe** - Arithmetic special functions unit (SFU). The SFU pipelines implement a special functions unit for computation of complex functions such as reciprocals and transcendental functions. Each SFU pipeline implements a 4-wide issue path, executing a 16-wide warp over 4 clock cycles.<br/>
**MSG pipe** - memory access ?<br/>
**Diverged instructions** - in 'false' branch.<br/>
