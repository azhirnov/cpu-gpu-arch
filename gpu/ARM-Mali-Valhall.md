## Notes

* The FMA and SVT pipelines are 16-wide, the SFU pipeline is 4-wide and runs at one quarter of the throughput of the other two. [4.2]
* Valhall maintains native support for int8, int16, and fp16 data types. These data types can be packed using SIMD instructions to fill each 32-bit data processing lane. This arrangement maintains the power efficiency and performance that is provided by the types that are narrower than 32-bits. [4.2]
* A single 16-wide warp maths unit can therefore perform 32x fp16/int16 operations per clock cycle, or 64x int8 operations per clock cycle. [4.2]

* LSU: [4.2]
	- 64-byte cache line.
	- 16KB L1 data cache per core
	- Warp unit accesses are optimized to reduce unique cache access requests. Data can be returned in a single cycle if all threads access data inside the same cache line.
* varying unit can interpolate 32 bits for every thread in a warp. [4.2]
* Variable rate shading (VRS).

## Notes

* scalar
* 16 threads per warp. [1.2, 4.2]
* Fragment Task with 32x32 pixels region. [1.2]
* AFBC (v1.3) with 4x4 block.
* MSAA: 4x, 8x, 16x
* Transaction Elimination with 16x16 pixel block size.

* All Valhall GPU cores implement a 4 texel-per-clock and 2 pixel-per-clock shader core.
* Mali Valhall GPU shader cores allow variable numbers of threads to be created, depending on the number of work registers that are used by the in-flight shader programs.
	- 0-32 registers - Maximum thread capacity
	- 33-64 registers - Half thread capacity
* A Valhall core can perform 32 FP32 FMAs, read 4 bilinear filtered texture samples, blend 2 fragments, and write 2 pixels per clock. [4.2]

* Each Processing Engine (PE) executes the programmable shader instructions. [4.2]
* Each PE includes 3 arithmetic processing pipelines: [4.2]
	- FMA pipeline with is used for complex maths operations
	- CVT pipeline which is used for simple maths operations
	- SFU pipeline which is used for special functions



### Subgroup threads order

Result of `Rainbow( gl_SubgroupInvocationID / gl_SubgroupSize )` in fragment shader, gl_SubgroupSize: 16, tile size: 32x32.

![](../img/graphics-subgroups/valhall-1.png)

Unique subgroups, image size: 32x32, gl_SubgroupSize: 16. Each subgroup in tile scheduled by quads (2x2 pixels), each quad may have any position inside 32x32 pixel tile, but often they are placed inside 8x8 region.<br/>
