## Notes

* Has low resolution Z pass: [1]<br/>
 "During the binning pass, a low resolution Z-buffer is constructed, and can reject LRZ-tile wide contributions to boost binning performance. This LRZ is then used during the rendering pass to reject pixels efficiently before testing against the full resolution Z-buffer."
* Has forward pass for fullscreen quad/triangle.

* Starting on A5X GPUs, an LRZ pass happens in binning and can discard tile wide contributions. [5]
* On A5X, GPUs push constants are not recommended. [5]
* On A5X GPUs, one (1) texture per fragment at full rate is equivalent to 16 full precision ALUs. [5]

* Adreno 660 core config:
	- 48 ALU
	- 650 MHz
	- fp64:  15.6 gflops, 1/4 fp32
	- fp32:  62.4 gflops
	- fp16: 124.8 gflops, 2x fp32

**Adreno 530**:
* has 2 compute queues. [2]
* 1SP: 32x Fp32, 4x SFU; it means sqrt/sin/cos executes in 1/8 rate; int executed in 1/4 rate. [2]
