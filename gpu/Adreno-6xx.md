* Has low resolution Z pass:
 "During the binning pass, a low resolution Z-buffer is constructed, and can reject LRZ-tile wide contributions to boost binning performance. This LRZ is then used during the rendering pass to reject pixels efficiently before testing against the full resolution Z-buffer."
* Has forward pass for fullscreen quad/triangle.
