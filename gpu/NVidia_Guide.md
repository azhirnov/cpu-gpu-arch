## Notes

* Only use signed integers (if possible), this can be faster. The compiler can optimize more aggressively with signed arithmetic than it can with unsigned arithmetic. [3]

* Constant/vertex/index buffers are faster with direct binds (A4Engine)

* In some cases compiler uses FP16 units to implement MOV (e.g. moving a number to a register by multiplying with zero and adding the value/constant it wants to move there). [nv forum]
* A warp scheduler in a modern GPU can schedule 2 instructions per cycle(using different pipelines). [3?]

* Nvidia has been using separate FP32 and FP64 units in their Streaming Multiprocessors (Pascal, Turing, Ampere) [?]
