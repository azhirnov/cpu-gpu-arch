## Notes

**CCU** - Color Cache Unit. Separate cache used by 2D blits and sysmem render target access (and also for resolves to system memory when in **GMEM** mode).<br/>
**CMP** - Compression and Decompression?<br/>
**DMA** - Direct memory access.<br/>
**draw 2D** - blit, fullscreen post process without TBDR ?<br/>
**draw 3D** - TBDR pass ?<br/>
**EU** - execution unit?<br/>
**EFU** - Elementary Function Unit ?. The EFU will have all the necessary instructions to speed up calculations and 3D rendering. (sin, cos, arctan, dot, rasterization, Min / Max, Clip, Culling , Sorting etc etc).<br/>
**FE** - Front End. Index buffer and vertex attribute fetch cluster. Includes **PC**, **VFD**, **VPC**.<br/>
**GMEM** - on-chip memory, used to store attachments during tiled rendering, or as shared memory for compute, or color/depth cache in immediate rendering.<br/>
**GM** - Global memory (RAM).<br/>
**GPR** - General Purpose Registers ?<br/>
**HLSQ** - High Level Sequencer. Manages state for the **SP**s, batches up PS invocations between primitives, is involved in preemption.<br/>
**ICL** - ?<br/>
**LRZ** - Low resolution Z. A low resolution area of the depth buffer that can be initialized during the binning pass to contain the worst-case (farthest) Z values in a block, and then used to early reject fragments during rasterization.<br/>
**LM** - Local memory. GMEM for compute is used as shared memory for waves.<br/>
**ME** - Microcode Engine, handles most **PM4** commands.<br/>
**maskgen** - ?<br/>
**PC** - ?<br/>
**PFP** - Prefetch Parser<br/>
**PM4** - AMD Radeonâ€™s command packet format.<br/>
**ROQ** - **DMA** engine used by the **SQE** for reading memory, with some prefetch buffering.<br/>
**RAS** - Rasterizer. Responsible for generating PS invocations from primitives, also does **LRZ**.<br/>
**RBBM** - Render backend ***(bus/busy?) manager ?<br/>
**RBuffer** - render/read buffer?<br/>
**RB** - Render Backend. Performs both early and late Z testing, blending, and attachment stores of output of the PS.<br/>
**SQE** - a6xx+ replacement for **PFP**/**ME**. This is the microcontroller that runs the microcode which actually processes the command stream and writes to the hardware registers.<br/>
**SP** - shader processor<br/>
**TSE** - Triangle Setup Engine<br/>
**TP** - Texture Processor.<br/>
**PVS** - Primitive Visibility Stream.<br/>
**PC_VS** - Cluster where varyings are read from **VPC** and assembled into primitives to feed **RAS**.<br/>
**UCHE** - Unified L2 cache. Cache behind the vertex fetch, **VSC** writes, texture L1, **LRZ**, and storage image accesses. Misses and flushes access system memory.<br/>
**VSD** - ?<br/>
**VBIF** - ?<br/>
**VFD** - Vertex Fetch and Decode.<br/>
**VPC** - Varying/Position Cache. Hardware block that stores shaded vertex data for primitive assembly.<br/>
**VSC** - Visibility Stream Compressor<br/>
**VS** - Vertex Shader. Responsible for generating VS/GS/tess invocations.<br/>
**VFDP** - ?<br/>
**wave** - warp, 32/64<br/>
**UBWC** - universal bandwidth compression.<br/>
**uSPTP** - Micro Shader Processor Texture Processor.<br/>
**com** - ?<br/>
**dcom** - ?<br/>
**color/depth blocks** - block of 4x4 pixels which will be compressed before transfer from GMem to global memory.<br/>


Warning: some devices requires root to access performance counters.

Some devices requires to enable performance counters from adb, which requires root on some devices: [ref](https://github.com/google/agi/issues/1113#issuecomment-1165786744)
```
adb shell "echo 1 > /sys/class/kgsl/kgsl-3d0/perfcounter"
```
