## Notes

* Dynamic shader core memory which allows an app to achieve better thread occupancy (2 virtual threads in one). [1]
* Flexible on-chip memory - 3 cache types now is dynamically allocated, if one type is not used - it will not be allocated. [1]
* fp32, fp16, int can execute in parallel. [1]
* Optimzied for fp16. [1]
* Hardware ray tracing. [1]
* Shader execution reordering. [1]
* In mesh shading: intermediate data from task shader now stored in the on-chip memory and accessed by mesh shader.
